title: Pod Evicted
description: |
  A data processing pod keeps crashing and getting evicted.
  It was working fine yesterday, but now Kubernetes keeps killing it.
theme: resources-scaling
difficulty: easy
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: |
  A data processing application is deployed as a single pod.
  The pod starts successfully but after a few seconds gets OOMKilled (Out of Memory).
  It enters a CrashLoopBackOff state and keeps restarting.
  The application code hasn't changed, but Kubernetes is now enforcing resource limits.
  The pod's memory usage exceeds the configured limit, causing eviction.
objective: |
  Fix the resource configuration so the pod can run without being evicted.
  Understand the difference between requests and limits, and how Kubernetes manages resources.
