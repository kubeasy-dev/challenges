# Kubeasy Challenges

This repository contains Kubernetes challenges for the Kubeasy platform. Each challenge simulates a real-world incident where users must investigate, diagnose, and fix issues using their Kubernetes knowledge.

## Philosophy

Kubeasy believes in **learning through discovery**. Our challenges:

- Put users in **realistic scenarios** without revealing the root cause
- Let users investigate using standard tools (`kubectl`, logs, events)
- Validate **outcomes**, not specific implementations
- Accept multiple valid solutions when possible

See our [Developer Guide](https://docs.kubeasy.dev/developer) for how to create new challenges and best practices.
