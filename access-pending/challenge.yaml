title: Access Pending
description: |
  The app was deployed, the image looks fine, but nothing starts. 
  Dig into what happens before the first log line ever appears.
theme: rbac-security
difficulty: advanced
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: | 
  A recent deployment was pushed using the usual CI process, with a custom image and a startup probe.  
  The application doesn't seem to be running as expected.  
  You're now responsible for diagnosing and unlocking the situation — but without modifying the image or bypassing any critical settings.
objective: |
  Ensure the application starts correctly and that the Pod becomes Ready.
  Something is blocking the startup sequence — your job is to identify the root cause
  and adjust the current configuration so the rollout can complete successfully.
