title: Secret Not Shared
description: |
  A microservice can't connect to the database because it's missing credentials.
  The Secret exists, but the pod doesn't have access to it.
theme: volumes-secrets

initial_situation: |
  A new microservice was deployed that needs to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
  The database credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret.
  The Secret exists and contains the correct username and password.
  However, the pod fails to start with an error: "DATABASE_PASSWORD environment variable not set".
  The deployment manifest has a reference to the Secret, but something is wrong with the configuration.
objective: |
  Fix the deployment configuration so the pod can access the database credentials from the Secret.
  The application expects credentials as environment variables: DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD.
