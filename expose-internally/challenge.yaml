title: Expose Internally
description: |
  The application is running, but other services in the cluster can't reach it.
  It needs to be accessible from within the cluster.

initialSituation: |
  A web application is deployed and running in the namespace.
  The pods are healthy and serving traffic on port 8080.
  However, there's no way for other pods to reach this application.
  You need to make it accessible using a Kubernetes Service.
objective: |
  Create a Service to expose the web application internally.
  Other pods in the cluster should be able to reach it using the service name.
