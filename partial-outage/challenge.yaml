initialSituation: |
  A frontend Deployment with 2 replicas and a backend Deployment with 1 replica are deployed in the same namespace.
  A NetworkPolicy is defined, but users still report issues — possibly related to intra-cluster communication.
objective: Ensure the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend over HTTP, while keeping traffic restricted.
