title: Out of Space
description: |
  Scaling worked... partially. One pod is happy, the others are stuck.
  They all want the same thing, but apparently they can't all have it.
theme: volumes-secrets
difficulty: medium
estimated_time: 20
initial_situation: |
  A PostgreSQL StatefulSet was running fine with a single replica.
  To improve availability, the team scaled it to 3 replicas.
  The first pod is Running normally, but pods 2 and 3 are stuck in Pending.
  The events mention something about volumes, but all PersistentVolumeClaims show as Bound.
objective: |
  Figure out why scaling breaks the deployment and get things working again.
  Not every problem is solved by throwing more replicas at it.
