title: Out of Space
description: |
  The database pod was working fine until this morning. Now it won't start.
  The logs mention something about mounting volumes, but the PVC shows as Bound.
theme: volumes-secrets
difficulty: intermediate
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: |
  A PostgreSQL database was deployed with persistent storage yesterday and was working normally.
  This morning, the pod started crash-looping with mount-related errors.
  The PersistentVolumeClaim appears to be bound, but something is preventing the pod from starting.
objective: |
  Get the database pod running again by resolving the storage mounting issue.
  The data must remain intact - do not recreate the PVC or lose existing data.
