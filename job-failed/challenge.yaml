title: Job Failed
description: |
  The nightly data processing job has been failing for the past week.
  It used to work fine, but now it times out and gets killed by Kubernetes.
theme: troubleshooting
difficulty: intermediate
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: |
  A CronJob that processes data every night has been consistently failing.
  The job starts running but gets terminated before completion.
  The processing logic hasn't changed, but something in the cluster configuration is causing issues.
objective: |
  Fix the job configuration so it can complete successfully within reasonable time limits.
  The job should run to completion without being killed by Kubernetes.
