title: Lost Logs
description: |
  The application is running, but logs are missing when trying to debug issues.
  Some containers show logs, others don't.
theme: monitoring-debugging
difficulty: easy
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: |
  A multi-container pod is deployed with a main application and a sidecar logger.
  The main application runs fine and you can see its logs with kubectl logs.
  However, the sidecar container writes logs to a file (/var/log/app.log) instead of stdout.
  When you try to check the sidecar logs with kubectl logs, nothing appears.
  This makes debugging issues with the logging system impossible.
objective: |
  Fix the logging configuration so all container logs are visible via kubectl logs.
  Ensure logs are written to stdout/stderr following 12-factor app principles.
