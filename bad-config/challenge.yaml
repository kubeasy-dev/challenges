title: Bad Config
description: |
  The configuration was updated hours ago, but nothing changed.
  The pods are living in the past.
theme: pods-containers
difficulty: easy
type: fix
estimatedTime: 15
starterFriendly: true
initialSituation: |
  A web application is deployed with its configuration in a ConfigMap.
  The team updated the ConfigMap to enable a new feature flag.
  Checking the ConfigMap shows the new values are definitely there.
  But the running application still uses the old configuration - as if the change never happened.
objective: |
  Make sure configuration changes actually reach the running application.
  Future config updates shouldn't silently fail like this.
