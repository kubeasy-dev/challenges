title: Traffic Jam
description: |
  The new microservice is deployed and running, but external traffic can't reach it.
  Internal services can communicate fine, but something is blocking ingress traffic.
theme: networking
difficulty: advanced
estimated_time: 20
initial_situation: |
  A microservice was deployed with proper service configuration and an ingress controller is running.
  The service is healthy and responds to internal cluster requests.
  However, external traffic through the ingress is getting 503 errors or timeouts.
objective: |
  Enable external traffic to reach the microservice through the ingress.
  External clients should be able to access the service at the configured hostname.
