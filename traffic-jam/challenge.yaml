title: Traffic Jam
description: |
  The pods work. The Service exists. The Ingress is configured. Yet: 503.
  Something invisible is blocking the traffic.
theme: networking
difficulty: hard
estimated_time: 20
initial_situation: |
  A microservice was deployed behind an Ingress controller for external access.
  The pods are Running and respond perfectly when accessed directly.
  The Service configuration looks correct and matches the pod labels.
  But accessing through the Ingress consistently returns 503 Service Unavailable.
objective: |
  Find what's breaking the traffic flow from Ingress to pods.
  Everything looks right on paper - dig deeper.
