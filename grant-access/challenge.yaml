title: Grant Access
description: |
  Your app needs to talk to the Kubernetes API.
  But by default, pods can't do much - you have to grant permissions explicitly.

initialSituation: |
  A monitoring application needs to list pods in its namespace.
  The app uses a dedicated ServiceAccount, but it has no permissions.
  When the app tries to list pods, it gets "Forbidden" errors.
objective: |
  Grant the ServiceAccount permission to list pods in its namespace.
  The application should be able to query the Kubernetes API successfully.
