title: Probes Drift
description: The app works perfectly in local tests. In Kubernetes? It never stays up long enough to find out.
theme: monitoring-debugging
difficulty: medium
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: |
  A notification service was deployed with health checks configured.
  The container starts, begins initialization, but Kubernetes keeps restarting it in a loop.
  There's no application error in the logs - it just keeps getting killed mid-startup.
objective: |
  Stop the crash loop and get the service running.
  The app is fine - something about how Kubernetes checks its health isn't right.
