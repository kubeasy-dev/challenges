title: Healthy App
description: |
  Kubernetes needs to know if your app is alive and ready.
  Without health checks, it's flying blind.
theme: monitoring-debugging
difficulty: easy
type: build
estimatedTime: 15
starterFriendly: true
initialSituation: |
  A simple web server is deployed but has no health checks configured.
  Kubernetes has no way to know if the application is healthy.
  If the app freezes or becomes unresponsive, nothing will detect it.
objective: |
  Configure health checks so Kubernetes can detect issues automatically.
  The app exposes a /health endpoint that returns 200 when healthy.

  - key: pod-ready
